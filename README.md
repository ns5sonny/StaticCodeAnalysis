# STATIC CODE ANALYSIS CAPSTONE - U.S. COAST GUARD ACADEMY

## PURPOSE
This project is our senior capstone project for our degree in Cyber Systems for the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. With a focus in best coding practices aligned with SEI CERT coding standrd, we are looking to improve the functionality of an existing static code analyzer, allowing it to find a vulnerability it cannot find already. 

## SOFTWARE AND CODING LANGUAGE
  For this project, we will be writing an add-on for the open source static code analysis tool, CPP Check. CPP Check was picked bcause we are confortable with coding in C and C++ because we have taken several classes using the language, in addition to CPP Check being the easiest to download and use. 
    However, CPP Check's add-ons are written in Python, requiring us to learn a new language and pivot our efforts.
